# Imagemorphing
Simple image mapping and TPS transformation 
## Deformation type
Rotation distortion  
Image distortion  
TPS  

## interpolation method
Nearest neighbor interpolation   
bilinear interpolation  
Bicubic interpolation  

## Note
Key point coordinates of the face needs to be provided to finish TPS face changing.  
I have also provided some sample images and Key point coordinates of the face.
